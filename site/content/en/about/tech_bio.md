# Josep in IT

I started tinkering with computers at age 15 and haven't stopped since. 

**Ruby** and **Rails** are my tools of choice at the moment, but there have been many other before and I have no doubt that newer and shinier toys will come in the future.

## Full stack web developer ...

Between 2005 and 2015 I've been involved in launching, running and growing [Evadium](http://www.evadium.com), an online travel agency specialized in short trips around Spain combined with activities and experiences designed to enjoy the local attractions.

Part of my tasks there involved designing, building and running the company's web site and its internal applications, including an online booking engine and supporting applications using a variety of tools, like **Ruby on Rails** and **PostgreSQL**, as well as several satellite Javascript and Ruby frameworks.

That experience, combined with past projects, has given me quite a grasp about the ins and outs of building and deploying real world web applications.


## ... with a rich experience before the web

All this web experience notwithstanding, the truth is that I cut my teeth in IT long before the Internet became mainstream.

Having worked both as a developer and a consultant, the number of technologies I've got to deal with is too long to list here and also would make me feel somewhat old (suffice to say that 8 bit computers and Z80 assembly would make it into that list).

Anyway, I'm specially keen of the years I spent using [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT) computers and NeXTstep developer tools, around the 90s, when Objective-C was seldom known and seemed like a dead-end career direction. Go and [see for yourself](http://markmail.org/message/cvov2pbnnirinp23). I still have my old [NeXTstation Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTstation) in its original packaging, although it hasn't been powered on for some years...

## With a pragmatic approach

As much as I enjoy IT for its own sake, along these years I've acquired an increasingly pragmatic vision about the field, having lived through a number of the tidal waves that periodically shake this industry, just to re-invent the wheel in newer and fancier colors.

As a consequence, nowadays I always try to apply a discerning eye when choosing and deploying technology, both for my own projects and for others'. Maybe the final product doesn't end up being as cutting edge as it could have been, but it usually turns up to be more effective and efficient.
