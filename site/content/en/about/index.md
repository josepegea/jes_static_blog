# Who is Josep Egea

<%= md_begin_block('div', :class => 'abstract') %>

Entrepreneur, parent, software guy, husband, photographer... Wearing many hats and always looking for a new puzzle to solve.

<%= md_end_block %>

Born in Barcelona, living in Madrid, thinking beyond geography. 

For the last years I've been a <%= l_link_to("freelance software
developer", "/about/tech_bio")%>, with experience in **Ruby on Rails**
and the full web stack. Currently I'm working with [Marketer.tech](https://marketer.tech) as a senior software developer and also as a team lead.

Until June 2015, I spent my days growing and running [Evadium](http://www.evadium.com), an online travel agency that I started back in 2005, together with my co-founding partner, David Cano.

## Can I help?

If you think we could work together, don't hesitate to <%= l_link_to("ask", "/about/contact")%>. These are my main work areas.

*	**Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails** contracting projects. I've been developing with Rails since 2006. You'll find more details in my <%= l_link_to("technical background", "/about/tech_bio")%> page.

*	**Photography Workshops and Assignments**. For several years I led photography workshops and expeditions in multiple locations, both around Spain and abroad. Take a look at some of my work [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/evadium/).

*	**Startup Projects**. I love to start new projects. If you're looking for advice in your new startup or think that we could launch something together, come on, <%= l_link_to("let me know!", "/about/contact")%>
