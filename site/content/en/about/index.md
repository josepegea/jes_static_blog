# Who is Josep Egea

> Entrepreneur, parent, IT guy, husband, photographer... Wearing many hats and always looking for a new puzzle to solve.

Born in Barcelona, living in Madrid, thinking beyond geography. 

At the moment I'm a <%= l_link_to("freelance software developer", "/about/tech_bio")%>, with experience in **Ruby on Rails** and the full web stack. I'm also in the process of launching a new business project (Hint: it involves educational tools).

Until June 2015, I spent my days growing and running [Evadium](http://www.evadium.com), an online travel agency that I started back in 2005, together with my co-founding partner, David Cano.

## Can I help?

If you think we could work together, don't hesitate to <%= l_link_to("ask", "/about/contact")%>. These are my main work areas.

*	**Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails** contracting projects. I've been developing with Rails since 2005, and, at this moment, I'm available <%= l_link_to("for hiring", "/about/contact")%>. Get more details in my <%= l_link_to("technical background", "/about/tech_bio")%> page.

*	**Photography Workshops and Assignments**. For several years I've led photography workshops and expeditions in multiple locations, both around Spain and abroad. Take a look at some of my work [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/evadium/).

*	**Startup Projects**. I love to start new projects. If you're looking for advice in your new startup or think that we could launch something together, come on, <%= l_link_to("let me know!", "/about/contact")%>
