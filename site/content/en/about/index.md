# Who is Josep Egea

> Entrepreneur, parent, IT guy, husband, photographer... Always looking for a new puzzle to solve.

Born in Barcelona, living in Madrid, thinking beyond geography. 

At the moment I'm a <%= l_link_to("freelance software developer", "/about/tech_bio")%>, with experience in **Ruby on Rails** and the full web stack. I'm also in the process of launching a new project (Hint: it involves educational tools).

Until June 2015, I spent my days growing and running [Evadium](http://www.evadium.com), an online travel agency that I started back in 2005, together with my co-founding partner, David Cano.
