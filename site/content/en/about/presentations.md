## Happiness, Lies and Rubocop (About linters and their usage)

**Presented on March, 2022, in [Madrid.rb](https://www.madridrb.com/topics/happiness-lies-and-rubocop-948)**

Ruby is optimized for happiness, but, are we all happy with the shared
style guides and linting rules?

Finding the right balance between common conventions and individual
coding style can be a delicate subject, specially for bigger teams.
In this talk we'll explore these limits and try to find a recipe for
making sure that Rubocop makes us all happier developers

## Concurrency in Ruby 3

**Presented on May, 2021, in [Madrid.rb](https://www.madridrb.com/events/mayo-2021-concurrency-in-ruby-3-655)**

**Ruby 3** introduced 2 interesting novelties: The **Fiber Scheduler**
and **Ractors**

In this talk we'll review all the concurrency options available in
Ruby, both before and after Ruby 3, including **Threads**, **Fibers**
and **Ractors**, and we'll try to **visualize** how each of them can
be used with **live coding** examples.

Join us and discover why **one execution flow per program is not
enough**!!

## Ruby GUI Apps: Beautiful inside AND outside

**Presented on January, 2021, in [Madrid.rb](https://www.madridrb.com/events/enero-2021-ruby-gui-apps-647)**

We all love the **beauty** of Ruby. It's powerful, flexible
and expressive. But most Ruby applications are doomed to run on
server farms, powering APIs and generating HTML or log messages as
their only visible output.

This doesn't have to be this way. **Ruby can have GUIs** and **GUIs can have
Ruby**.

In this talk we'll have some fun writing desktop GUI Apps using Ruby. And
will experience how **the end result** is **much more than the sum of the
parts**.

Join us and share the joy!

## Fun with Ruby, Android and Termux

**Presented on March, 2019, in [Madrid.rb](https://www.madridrb.com/events/marzo-2019-539)**

With the advent of smartphones, **Linux/Unix** has succeeded as the
most used OS worldwide.

But truth is that both Android and iOS keep most of the Unix fun under
the hood, not only from users, but also from a majority of developers.

Now, thanks to **Termux**, we can get this fun back, at least in
**Android**.

In this talk we'll use our tried and true **Ruby** toolchain to do
plenty of wild things with our mobiles. No Android Studio needed. No
Java code. No Android developer account. No app approval process.

Just your code, in your pocket. Let's have some fun!
