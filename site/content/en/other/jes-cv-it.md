After some months collaborating with them as an external consultant specialized in software development and IT market trends, I joined the company in 2000, to manage the custom analysis area.

Having completed a certified NeXT developer camp in 1992, I joined Nexus to be part of the small team of developers. After a few months, I became project manager and eventually took the technical lead of the company.

While at Nexus, my team developed business applications using NeXTstep / OpenStep (first) and MacOS X (later), supporting the complete business processes for two companies: a ceramic tile manufacturer and a paint and coat producer. Covering areas from production to sales (domestic and foreign), those applications were written in Objective-C, using the NeXT/Apple frameworks (DBKit, Enterprise Objects Framework, Cocoa) and SQL database servers from Sybase and Oracle.

At Nexus we also developed websites and ecommerce applications using a proprietary stack that we built around NeXT technology. It included a custom scripting language, designed and implemented by ourselves, that could be embedded in HTML pages, just like PHP or ERB templates, and integrated with ad hoc server applications that managed database connectivity, session state, etc. Using those tools we built several websites, including DiscoWeb.com, one of the first online music stores in Spain, and the corporate site for Smint.
