## Other

### *Nexus Servicios de Información **1993-2000*** Software Developer, Project Manager and Technical Lead

At the time, Nexus was an ISP that also developed custom business
applications for companies in the industrial sector, using NeXTstep
software. Having completed a certified NeXT developer camp in 1992, I
joined Nexus to be part of the small team of developers. After a few
months, I became project manager and eventually took the technical
lead of the company.

While at Nexus, my team developed business applications using NeXTstep
/ OpenStep (first) and MacOS X (later), supporting the complete
business processes for two companies: a ceramic tile manufacturer and
a paint and coat producer. Covering areas from production to sales
(domestic and foreign), those applications were written in
Objective-C, using the NeXT/Apple frameworks (DBKit, Enterprise
Objects Framework, Cocoa) and SQL database servers from Sybase and
Oracle.

At Nexus we also developed websites and ecommerce applications using a
proprietary stack that we built around NeXT technology. It included a
custom scripting language, designed and implemented by ourselves, that
could be embedded in HTML pages, just like PHP or ERB templates, and
integrated with ad hoc server applications that managed database
connectivity, session state, etc. Using those tools we built several
websites, including DiscoWeb.com, one of the first online music stores
in Spain, and the corporate site for Smint.

**Relevant technologies**: NeXTstep, OpenStep, Mac OS X, Cocoa,
Objective-C, UNIX stack, Lexx & Yacc, Sybase SQL Server, Oracle, CVS,
UML.

### *Disseny i Gestió Informàtica, s.l. **1990-1993*** Co-founder and Software Developer

While at college, and together with two other students there, we
founded Disseny i Gestió Informàtica, s.l., a custom software
development company for Small & Medium Business.

We built accounting, sales and production management applications
using DOS and Turbo Pascal 5.5, along with supporting software, like
Btrieve, later evolving to C/C++, Delphi and Windows.

### ***1990-2000*** Freelance writer and translator for IT magazines

For several years, I worked with various technical magazines and
publications translating content written in English by the American
headquarters and adapting it for the Spanish market.

With the time, I also wrote original content for those publishers,
centered around operating systems (and Linux in particular), software
development, new tools, etc.

My articles appeared in the Spanish editions of several magazines,
like **Byte**, **Datamation**, **PCPlus** and others. I also wrote IT
articles for the generic newspaper **El Periódico de Catalunya**.
