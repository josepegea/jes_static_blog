  <h3 id="madrid-rb-2015-data-migration-tool-for-the-group-website"><em>Madrid-rb <strong>2015</strong></em> Data migration tool for the group website</h3>

  <p>As part of the migration of the website for the Madrid Local Ruby User Group (Madrid-rb), I co-developed, along with other members of the group, a set of Ruby scripts to scrap and capture the existing data, scattered among several sites, exporting the results as JSON data to be imported into the new website platform.</p>

  <p>The existing sites were hosted across several self publishing platforms (GitHub, Jottit), and used a variety of heterogeneous templates, so the scrapper had to understand all of them and convert them into a coherent dataset.</p>

  <p><strong>Relevant technologies</strong>: Ruby 1.9.3, Nokogiri, JSON.</p>

  <p>As part of the viability study for a side project, I developed a prototype for a photo showcase website, with support for portfolio galleries, photographer profiles and different options for sharing and selling the pictures, including prints, licensing and many others in the future.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, further business case study showed that future viability was not as promising as once appeared, so I suspended the project to focus on other opportunities.</p>

  <p>For the prototype I developed a Ruby on Rails 3.2 web application with several modules for general photo management, including cataloguing, resizing, thumbnailing, as well as general content management for the site pages, photographers, etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Relevant technologies</strong>: Ruby 1.9.3, Rails 3.2, PostgreSQL 9.1, ImageMagic, RMagick, Devise, ActiveAdmin, Globalize, Bootstrap 3, SASS, Liquid (template processing), jQuery and jQuery Panzoom.</p>

  <p>Penteo is an Independent IT Analyst that helps CIOs and IT departments of medium and large companies to better integrate IT in their business processes. Its services include market research, benchmarking, specific training for IT staff and custom consulting and analysis.</p>

  <p>After some months collaborating with them as an external consultant specialized in software development and IT market trends, I joined the company in 2000, to manage the custom analysis area.</p>

  <p>During 7 years, I held different positions in analysis, consulting, research and business development, working in several IT areas, like Outsourcing management, ERP software deployment, IT department reorganization or optimization of development teams, to name a few.</p>

  <h3 id="nexus-servicios-de-informacin-1993-2000-software-developer-project-manager-and-technical-lead"><em>Nexus Servicios de Información <strong>1993-2000</strong></em> Software Developer, Project Manager and Technical Lead</h3>

  <p>At the time, Nexus was an ISP that also developed custom business applications for companies in the industrial sector, using NeXTstep software. Having completed a certified NeXT developer camp in 1992, I joined Nexus to be part of the small team of developers. After a few months, I became project manager and eventually took the technical lead of the company.</p>

  <p>While at Nexus, my team developed business applications using NeXTstep / OpenStep (first) and MacOS X (later), supporting the complete business processes for two companies: a ceramic tile manufacturer and a paint and coat producer. Covering areas from production to sales (domestic and foreign), those applications were written in Objective-C, using the NeXT/Apple frameworks (DBKit, Enterprise Objects Framework, Cocoa) and SQL database servers from Sybase and Oracle.</p>

  <p>At Nexus we also developed websites and ecommerce applications using a proprietary stack that we built around NeXT technology. It included a custom scripting language, designed and implemented by ourselves, that could be embedded in HTML pages, just like PHP or ERB templates, and integrated with ad hoc server applications that managed database connectivity, session state, etc. Using those tools we built several websites, including DiscoWeb.com, one of the first online music stores in Spain, and the corporate site for Smint.</p>

  <p><strong>Relevant technologies</strong>: NeXTstep, OpenStep, Mac OS X, Cocoa, Objective-C, UNIX stack, Lexx &amp; Yacc, Sybase SQL Server, Oracle, CVS, UML.</p>

  <p>While at college, and together with two other students there, we founded Disseny i Gestió Informàtica, s.l., a custom software development company for Small &amp; Medium Business.</p>

  <p>We built accounting, sales and production management applications using DOS and Turbo Pascal 5.5, along with supporting software, like Btrieve, later evolving to C/C++, Delphi and Windows.</p>

  <h3 id="freelance-writer-and-translator-for-it-magazines"><strong><em>1990-2000</em></strong> Freelance writer and translator for IT magazines</h3>

  <p>For several years, I worked with various technical magazines and publications translating content written in English by the American headquarters and adapting it for the Spanish market.</p>

  <p>With the time, I also wrote original content for those publishers, centered around operating systems (and Linux in particular), software development, new tools, etc.</p>

  <p>My articles appeared in the Spanish editions of several magazines, like <strong>Byte</strong>, <strong>Datamation</strong>, <strong>PCPlus</strong> and others. I also wrote IT articles for the generic newspaper <strong>El Periódico de Catalunya</strong>.</p>
